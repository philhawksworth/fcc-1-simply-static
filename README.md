## freeCodeCamp JAMstack examples

# 1 - All simply static

This repo holds one of a series of examples of JAMstack sites from a freeCodeCamp video. The video, "Introduction to JAMstack" is available to view for free on freeCodeCamp.

## About this example

The first of our 6 code examples, this is a very basic starting point. Just a single, static asset which we will build on as the tutorial progresses.

In the video, we show this single asset site being deployed via [Netlify Drop](https://netlify.com/drop?utm_source=github&utm_medium=fcc-examples-pnh&utm_campaign=devex) for the simplest drag and drop CDN deployment.

## Local development

To work on this example locally, you can clone the repository and simply start editing. There is no build step or any pre-requisites.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/philhawksworth/fcc-1-simply-static
```

## Clone and deploy

If you wanted to quickly clone this repository and deploy it as a new site on [Netlify](https://www.netlify.com?utm_source=github&utm_medium=fcc-examples-pnh&utm_campaign=devex) you can click the button below for a rapid start.
